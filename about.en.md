The **STRUDEL** team of the **[LaSTIG](https://umr-lastig.fr)** lab is interested in the *data*, *data structures*, *algorithms* and *models* required for *territory analysis* towards a better *understanding* of its *mecanisms* and its *evolutions*. Such analyses are lead in partnership with users and guided by some of their needs: public prescribers, researchers in modeling, geography, social sciences and private companies. This project covers questions related to:

- the **integration** of heterogeneous, multi-sources and multi-dimensional data,

- the **organisation of data** (concepts, analysis levels, identification of relevant structures/objects/elements, imperfection sources, etc.),

in order to:
- **develop models and algorithms** taking into account the *structure* (spatial, temporal, spectral, modal) of data for a better precision of results, a better integration of relevant objects, of spatial representation or to optimise their computation,
- **reason** *in fine* **on spatialised phenomena**, **detect and characterise change**,  **semantics-enable**, **simulate**, etc.
